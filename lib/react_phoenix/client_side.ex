  Functions to make rendering React components easy in Phoenix views.

  Combined with the javascript also included in this package, rendering React
  components in your Phoenix views can be much easier. The module was built
  with Brunch in mind (vs Webpack). Since Phoenix uses Brunch by default, this
  package can make getting React into your application much faster than
  switching over to a different system.

  Generate a div containing the named React component with no props or options.

  Returns safe html: `{:safe, [60, "div", ...]}`.

  You can utilize this in your Phoenix views:

  ```
  <%= ReactPhoenix.ClientSide.react_component("MyComponent") %>
  ```

  The resulting `<div>` tag is formatted specifically for the included javascript
  helper to then turn into your named React component.

  ```
  <%= ReactPhoenix.ClientSide.react_component("MyComponent", %{language: "elixir", awesome: true}) %>

  Generate a div containing the named React component and pass it props and options.

  Returns safe html: `{:safe, [60, "div", ...]}`.

  For now, props MUST be passed in as a Map. The only option currently accepted is `target_id`.
  If you pass in a `target_id`, the resulting `<div>` tag will tell the javascirpt helper
  which HTML element you'd like to render the React component. This is helpful in scenarios
  like server-side rendering of a component.

  You can utilize this in your Phoenix views:

  ```
  <%= ReactPhoenix.ClientSide.react_component(
        "MyComponent",                        # <- component name
        %{language: "elixir", awesome: true}, # <- props
